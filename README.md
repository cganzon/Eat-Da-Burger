# Eat Da Burger!

Eat Da Burger! is an application that allows users to "eat" burgers by clicking on them. After the user clicks on a certain burger, that burger is transferred to the "eaten" column for the user to keep track of. Also, the user is able to add their own burgers, which can then be eaten and transferred to the "eaten" column as well.
